Relationship Between Web Servers and Application Servers:
In many web application architectures, web servers and application servers work together. This setup is often referred to as a "reverse proxy" configuration. In this scenario, the web server handles incoming client requests, serves static content directly to clients, and then forwards dynamic requests to the application server. The application server processes the requests, executes application logic, interacts with databases, and generates the dynamic content that the web server returns to the client.

This separation of responsibilities allows for better scalability, security, and load distribution. Web servers focus on efficiently delivering static content, while application servers handle the more complex processing and dynamic content generation
