# Regular expressions 

## Important notes

* Regular expressions (also known as regex or regexp) are a sequence of characters that define a search pattern.

* They are used to search, replace, and manipulate text in programming languages and text editors.

* Regular expressions can be used to match specific characters, words, or patterns within a larger string of text.

* They consist of a combination of literals, metacharacters, and quantifiers.
Literals are characters that match themselves, such as letters and digits.

* Metacharacters are special characters that have a specific meaning in regular expressions, such as the dot (.) which matches any character, or the asterisk (*) which matches zero or more of the preceding character.

* Quantifiers specify how many times a character or pattern should be matched, such as the plus sign (+) which matches one or more of the preceding character.

* Regular expressions are often used in conjunction with functions or methods that search for or replace text, such as the find() or replace() methods in Python.

* Regular expressions can be complex and difficult to read, but they are very powerful for manipulating and searching text.
